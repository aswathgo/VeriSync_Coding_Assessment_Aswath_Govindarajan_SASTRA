# VeriSync_Coding_Assessment_Aswath_Govindarajan_SASTRA

## Let me
start by establishing the premise and by defining a few very basic
keywords, before proceeding with detailed answers for the questions asked in the assessment:

i\) *Digital Ledger Technology:*  
- It is a system to digitally keep track
of & store data, meta information & transaction details that is spread
across many locations, at the same time. A conventional centralized
ledger (a record of transactions) is often monitored by one paramount
authority which controls its every operation, but unlike that, a DLT
breaks down the total data into chunks and distributes them across a
network of computers. In this way, the system gets decentralised.
- Each computer that is a part of the network is called a node, and it
participates in the network by having a copy of a ledger, and executes
the consensus mechanisms
- For a new data to be appended to the ledger,
each node in the network must acknowledge and approve of the new
entrant's validity, in a process called "Consensus mechanism". This step
ensures that, even in the absence of a single all-encompassing central
authority, security, accuracy and authenticity are upheld in DLTs.
- Following the Consensus Mechanism, once a data is added, it is virtually
impossible to make any amendments, changes to that data, ensuring its
safety and security from undesirable fraudulent mutations.

ii\) *Blockchain:* 
- A form of DLT is Blockchain technology, in which
information is segregated into "Blocks" that are "chained" together
- A block contains two things: a reference linking to the previous block,
and the data comprising of the set of transactions. Such a reference
linking creates an immutable chronological order of the stored
transactions
- Blockchain uses highly efficient cryptographic encryption
techniques to store and verify each block, thereby preventing breach of
data integrity and the risk of tampering, while also providing
transparency thanks to its decentralised nature

iii\) *Ethereum:* 
- It is a Blockchain platform that provides more
versatility in the platform to take it beyond just a DLT.
- It has
enabled a completely new field, building decentralised apps (dApps),
which are applications that can utilise the perks of a decentralised
network, in varied domains other than just a Ledger.
- Ethereum also
provides Smart Contracts, which are auto-executing code-blocks that run
when specific parameters are met.

## Question 1: Polygon Miden Research

### Section 1: Core Concepts

#### Part (a) - Clearly explain the core concepts of Polygon Miden, including its architecture, consensus mechanism, and key features. 

Ans) Let me
start by giving an introduction to Polygon, before proceeding with a detailed explanation of Polygon Miden


i\) *Polygon:* 
- At its core, Polygon, previously called Matic, is a
network that functions as an add-on to Ethereum to enhance its
performance. It can be described as "Ethereum's Internet of Blockchain",
as it forms a well-connected network in which multiple blockchains can
work in tandem with Ethereum at its core.
- Though Ethereum is the most
popular blockchain platform, as the number of people who use it
increases, its performance plummets, while its operational cost rises.
Polygon aims to prevent these drawbacks, by providing a framework to
build interconnected and scalable blockchain networks, that execute and
handle transactions outside of the Main Ethereum Network.

ii\) *Features of Polygon:*  
- *Layer 2 Solution:* On top of the base layer
(Layer 1) that mainly handles consensus mechanisms, transaction
validation among other things, a "Layer 2" solution is provided by
Polygon, where most of the transactions take place. This is done inorder
to reduce the congestion in Layer 1 (the Ethereum layer). Once
transactions are processed off the base layer, they are finalised in the
base layer.
- *Scalability:* By providing the Layer 2 architecture, the
capacity to handle transactions, without increase in cost, is improved.
This is a result of a large number of transactions being processed
independently, without adding any load on the base layer. This process
of increasing the capacity is called scalability.

Now that the very basic concepts required to understand Polygon are
covered, let us delve deeper into the core concepts of Polygon Miden,
including its architecture, consensus mechanism, and key features.

i\) *Polygon Miden and its features:* 
- It is an advanced tech stack
present within Polygon, that enhances privacy and scaling ability by
providing Zero Knowledge Roll Ups
- *Roll Ups:* It is a type of Layer 2
solution, exhibited by Polygon, in which many transactions are bundled
(rolled up) together as one unit, and are submitted as a single batch
back to the base layer, whenever that is done.
- *Zero Knowledge:* The
Roll Ups furnished by Polygon are Zero-Knowledge in nature, meaning, a
"prover" can demonstrate to a "verifier" that the prover is aware of a
critical information like whether a transaction is valid, without
revealing any other data and finer details that may lay underneath.
Without sharing much information, it is proved that a batch of
transactions in Layer 2 roll ups are valid, by submitting a single
unique cryptographic proof to the main blockchain in Layer 1.
- *Decentralisation:* Despite the presence of an additional Layer 2,
decentralisation is observed in ways such as: Verification of the
zk-STARK proofs can be done by any party without the need for an
all-encompassing centralised intermediary; finality of the proofs are
provided by the validator nodes, which exhibit a good degree of
decentralisation
- *Privacy:* Since it is a Zero Knowledge proof
etiquette, only a very little amount of key information is furnished to
proof the validity, shielding sensitive data from unwantedly being shown
outside
- *Transparency:* zk_STARK proofs, and code blocks of the Smart
Contracts are transparent, and can be viewed by any user at any point of
time.

ii\) *Advantages provided by Polygon Miden:* 
- A majority of the
transactions are offloaded to the Layer 2 network, this reduces the
transaction costs
- Since Polygon Miden is compatible with Ethereum,
applications can directly be deployed to Polygon without any necessity
to change the Ethereum-based code. This perk ensures easy integration of
decentralised apps from Ethereum to Polygon
- The faster processing
thanks to ZK Rollups also improve scalability
- Thanks to Zero Knowledge
proofs, sensitive information is not shared to the blockchain at all.
Despite this, the validity of transactions are verified. It enhances the
privacy and security of the whole network
- Multiple blockchains can
coexist in the ecosystem provided by Polygon and can work hand-in-hand,
thereby presenting an interoperable space which benefits the entire
blockchain.

iii\) *Architecture of Polygon Miden:* The individual components that make
up Polygon Miden are listed below, followed by the working mechanism of
how each component interacts with each other to provide the desired
functionality:

1\. *Miden Virtual Machine:* It is the VM that executes the batched
off-chain transactions. It is specialised to provide zk-STARK proofs for
the execution of the transactions. To elaborate, zk-STARK stands for
Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge, and is a zero
knowledge cryptographic protocol that provides validity for transactions
by using polynomial functions and hash functions to create proofs,
without sharing the sensitive input data, through a process called
Interactive Oracle Proofs. The execution layer of the VM executes both
the transactions and the smart contracts in the Layer 2. Following that,
zk-STARK proofs are generated to attest to the proper execution of the
batched transactions. They are then verified one last time on-chain

2\. *Miden Nodes:* Like in every blockchain network, Miden runs on a
distributed system of nodes, which primarily perform two functions:  
- *Provers:* They generate the zk-STARK proofs, and are computationally very
intensive
- *Verifiers:* They confirm the accuracy, validity of the
zk-STARK proofs that are later submitted to the Layer 1 Ethereum
network, and are also responsible for accepting or rejecting the rollup
batches

3\. *Smart Contract:* It is a key component of Miden, that receives the
zk_STARK proofs from the VM, and validates the proofs to confirm the
validity of the rolled up transactions. It essentially acts as an anchor
between Layer 1 and Layer 2. It is self executing, and gets executed
once it validates the proofs. Additionally, the smart contracts are
immutable and the code blocks involving them is publicly visible

iv\) *Working Mechanism of Miden:*

1\. Upon initiation from a user, transactions are made into singular
batches and sent to Miden 

2\. The batched transactions are then executed
in the VM 

3\. After they are executed, the VM checks for any "State
changes", an aggregation of the new and updated state of all values and
balances upon the completion of processing 

4\. When the state changes are
finally found out, zk-STARK proofs for each batch are made 

5\. Since it
is zero knowledge in nature, only a very little quantity of key
information is then sent along with the proof to the Layer 1 Ethereum
thanks to the Smart Contract 

6\. In the main chain, Ethereum's validators
verify the proof submitted by Miden. 

7\. After verification, the Smart
Contract updates the state on the main chain, which reflects the final
states computed in the Layer 2 processing.

v\) *Consensus Mechanism of Miden:* All the participant nodes in a network
need to provide their "consensus" (agreement) on the validity of a
transaction, and the state of the ledgers. Instead of adopting
conventional Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake,
Polygon Miden - as a result of functioning as a Layer 2 roll up -
provides the consensus mechanism in the following manner:  

1. *Proof
Generation:* Following Transaction Batching by a sequencer node, zk-STARK
proof construction is done in the VM by the sequencer.

2. *Verification:*
Validator node on the Layer 1 Ethereum network verifies the proofs that
were submitted and updates the final states (a dedicated Validator
network is not needed for consensus)

_____________________________________________

#### Question (b) - How does Miden differ from other ZK-rollup solutions like zkSync and StarkNet? 

Ans: I shall first briefly talk about zkSync
and StarkNet and then proceed to elaborate on the difference between
them and Miden

*zkSync* 
- It is an ethereum compatible layer 2 solution that uses
zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
proofs for its rollups. zk-SNARKs require a trusted setup phase, where
certain key cryptographic parameters are initially generated and
publicly shared. The trusted setup is a potential weak link in this
setup. It supports Account Abstraction, allowing a user to customise the
type of account used as per their choice. zkSync era is a version of
zkSync that was further developed to be compatible with Ethereum Virtual
Machine, which was in later times adopted to suit zero knowledge proofs.
zkSync is widely used for payments, DeFi applications, and NFTs due to
its low transaction costs and fast confirmation times.

*StarkNet* 
- StarkNet is another general purpose Layer 2 solution that
uses zk-STARKs. StarkNet uses Cairo, a custom programming language
optimized for creating zk-STARK proofs. Cairo aids in making the
calculations and computations "provable". StarkNet supports
general-purpose smart contracts, enabling it to handle complex
applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), games, and NFT
marketplaces.

Now, let's discuss the differences between Miden and zkSync and
StarkNet.

1\. *Programming & Execution Environment:* StarkNet uses Cairo programming
language that is highly optimised for zk-STARKs (though learning yet
another new language is often a barrier), while zkSync and Miden run on
Virtual Machines respectively. Miden stands out as unlike zkSync, Miden
is not EVM compatible, thereby having a barrier in the form of custom
development learning to migrate dApps from Ethereum to Miden.

2\. *Where they are used:* While StarkNet is predominantly used in
applications that require high computational power like Decentralised
Finance projects and games, zkSync focuses specifically on NFTs and
token transfers and payments thanks to its EVM compatibility. Miden, on
the other hand, is interoperable with Ethereum, and can support
high-throughput applications and can scale effectively as well.

3\. *What kind of ZK Proof is used:* StarkNet uses zk_STARKs much akin to
Miden - and they do not need a trusted setup, while zkSync differs by
using zk_SNARKs and by needing a trusted setup

4\. *Transparency and risk involved:* Following on from the above point,
having a trusted setup makes zkSync a little more susceptible to being
compromised, as compared to the other two who have high transparency as
they do not require a trusted setup.

_____________________________________________

#### Question (c) What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of Miden compared to other solutions?

Ans: The differences between Miden and other zk based solutions were
discussed in the previous question. From the understanding of those
differences, the following pros and cons can be sketched:

*Advantages:*  
1\. *Interoperability:* Polygon also provides other Layer 2
scaling solutions in their ecosystem, which Miden can connect with and
make good use of, hence if any dApp wants to make use of other Layer 2
Services, it can effortlessly achieve that.

2\. *The future-proofness of zk_STARKs:* The rise of Quantum computing
makes many cryptographic algorithms redundant, with its increased
deciphering capabilities. But zk_STARK is immune to such QC attacks, as
its underlying algorithm is mathematically more resistant compared to
its alternatives.

3\. Compared to EVM compatible solutions, Miden, having its own custom
made Miden Virtual Machine, is more adept at zk-STARK proof generation

4\. Since it uses zk-STARK, it is by nature, very highly scalable and
has a great throughput, thus finding prominent use in computation
intensive and information dense applications like DeFi. Another
advantage of using zk-STARK is that it doesn't need any trusted setups,
which adds a whole another dimension of transparency to the system.

*Disadvantages:*  
1\. Though it can be interoperable with Polygon's other
ecosystem services, the same unfortunately cannot be said about
Ethereum's ecosystem, due to the lack of compatibility with EVM. zkSync,
on the other hand, is very tightly knit with the Ethereum ecosystem, and
so, dApps looking for seamless Ethereum interaction might prefer zkSync
over this.

2\. Developers definitely need to scale a sizeable learning curve, with
Miden, to accustom themselves with the Miden VM. Alternatives like
zkSync on the other hand do not have such a learning curve, as it uses
Solidity, Ethereum's own primary language for development.

3\. Lack of compatibility with EVM, much like it was discussed in point
number 1, also poses other issues as developers have to rewrite their
applications to run in Miden VM. This makes the migration task of dApps
from Ethereum much harder.

### Section 2: Technical Deep Dive:

#### Question (a): Describe the underlying cryptographic primitives used in Miden, such as STARKs and FRI.

Ans) *Abbreviations:* 

*FRI* - Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of
Proximity 

*STARK* - Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge

Both of these exist to enable zero knowledge proofs. Let us discuss them
in detail:

*STARK:* 
- It is a cryptographic proofs technique that allows a prover
node to convince a verifier node that a statement is true without
revealing any extraneous information about the statement. STARKS are
known for their scalability, transparency and their immunity against
quantum attacks.
- Any participant node can independently generate the
zk proof in STARK, thus randomness and transparency are achieved.

Let's breakdown the name STARK, before moving on to understanding the
working mechanism: 
- *Scalable:* STARKs can generate and verify proofs for
highly intensive computations with a minimal increase in processing
might, thus being effectively scalable
- *Transparent:* This property
arises thanks to not relying on any "trusted setup" to initialise the
cryptographic parameters. STARKS work on public randomness that can be
generated by anyone, such as hash functions or random beacons, instead
of relying on secret parameters, which ultimately lends the
transparency
- *ARgument:* When a proof is given by the prover without
disclosing many of the details to the verifier, it's called an argument.
STARKs are secure under the assumption that the prover has limited
computational resources. In general, such arguments can be broken if a
sufficiently powerful machine is employed. But, in the case of STARKs,
it is not practically possible to break the proofs
- *Knowledge:* It
stands for zero-knowledge proof, where the prover can convince the
verifier of the validity of a statement without revealing any
information (like the input or other associated data) beyond the fact
that the statement is true.

*Working Mechanism:*  

1\. *Encoding Computation:* A sequence of operations
denoting a transaction is taken, and it is encoded as a sequence of
algebraic operations. These are represented in the form of Logic gate
circuits, in which each gate denotes an operation and the circuit on the
whole represents that entire sequence of operations. From this circuit,
we obtain polynomials. In this process, the inputs and outputs of the
gates are explicitly shown as polynomials too. This way of representing
it as polynomials is what enables the prover to prove it in a ZK manner

2\. *Evaluation of the obtained polynomial:* A polynomial of degree d is
tested by evaluating it at a smaller number of points that are randomly
chosen. Thus the verifier checks only a few points instead of the whole
computation. To interpolate, the prover uses techniques like La Grange
Interpolation to recover the polynomial's value at any specific point,
when the value at a few points is given. With this, the prover provides
the verifier just enough values required to confirm the correctness of
the polynomial. 

3\. *Generation of the proof:* The randomly chosen points,
the values at those points, all the polynomials are taken to perform the
transformation. The prover uses a Hash function to provide his
commitment to the verifier, who can thus check the properties of the
polynomial without getting to see the polynomial totally at all. STARKs
often use cryptographic hash functions H for commitment schemes that
take an input m and produces a fixed-size output H(n) : {0,1}\* -\>
{0,1}^n. Other interactive protocols are used by the two nodes to
communicate between each other. Upon committing, the prover cannot make
changes to the polynomial. 

4\. *Verification:* The verifier generates
random challenges (queries) to the prover based on the committed
polynomial and checks the responses. The verifier randomly selects
points and requests polynomial evaluations at those points. The prover
responds with the values. FRI (more details on FRI will follow) is
employed here, where the verifier checks that the polynomial is indeed
of low degree. To test if a polynomial P(x) is of low degree, we utilize
the property of polynomials: If P(x) is a degree d polynomial, it can be
uniquely determined by its values at d+1 distinct points. If the
polynomial is found to be of low degree, it confirms that the
computation was performed correctly.

*FRI: Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity:*

FRI is a
key component used in STARKs to verify if a function is close to a
low-degree polynomial, that represents computations. Low-degree
polynomials have properties which can be easily spotted and predicted,
which make it easier to detect alteration or incorrect computations. It
provides Miden with an effective way to ensure that every step in the
computation can be sequentially represented as low-degree polynomials.

- *Fast:* When furnished with minimal amount of information, FRI can
quickly perform the computations at low operational costs.
- *Reed
Solomon Code:* They are a family of error-correcting codes, primarily
used in communication systems, that represent a sequence of values as
evaluations of a low-degree polynomial. Reed Solomon Codes are used
because representing data as a polynomial of low degree is key to FRI.
- *Interactive:* FRI provides the option to make the communication between
the prover and the verifier interactive and synchronised. If the queries
posted by the verifier are replaced with hash functions, the
interactiveness is lost.
- *Oracle:* In common parlance, an oracle is a
black-box function that provides answers to specific queries without
revealing the full information. Here, the prover acts as the oracle for
the polynomials.
- *Proof of proximity:* Instead of calculating if the
polynomial p(x) has a specific degree, FRI only computes if the degree
of the polynomial is less than a given number. This reduces the overhead
computation and eases the processing.

*Working principle:* 

*Initial States:* 

*Prover* - possesses a polynomial P(x)
that the prover claims is of a low degree, say 'd'. 

*Verifier* - without
checking all the points in the domain of P(x), the verifier aims to
check and validate if the given polynomial is actually proximal to the
low degree as the prover claims. 

*P(x)'s domain* - The domain is the set
of all points in a Galois (Finite) field

1\. A sequence of lower-degree polynomials are constructed by the prover
initially, by reducing the degree each time in the following manner -
layerwise. At each layer i, a new polynomial P_i(x) with degree = 1/2 \*
(degree of the previous polynomial P_i-1 (x) ) is obtained by combining
points in the polynomial’s evaluation. The degree in each layer halves
compared to its predecessor, ensuring that the polynomial size shrinks
progressively. 

2\. For each layer i, the prover uses the polynomial
evaluations at points in D_i to compute evaluations at D_i+1. The
process continues until the polynomial P(x) has been reduced to a very
low degree. 

3\. Now, the verifier takes a few points from each layer
randomly, and at all those points, calls the prover to furnish
evaluations. 

4\. 
- *Expected:* For each point that was taken, the verifier
checks if the polynomial at that point matches with the expected
degree-reduced values from the previous layer. 
- *Undesirable:* If the
evaluations do not align consistently, it suggests the polynomial is not
close to the intended low degree. 

5\. To cross verify the results, if
more points are sampled, the verifier can detect deviations and
anomalies with a higher probability, and then establish a confidence
level based on that. 

6\. *Conclusion:* If all sampled points match the
expected values, the verifier concludes that the polynomial is
approximately the desired degree. However, if any discrepancies are
detected, the verifier rejects the proof.

This way, FRI plays an important role with STARK in Miden, to provide
the computational trace of the transactions as polynomials with low
degree, while maintaining scalability and transparency.

_____________________________________________

#### Question (b): How does Miden achieve scalability and security while maintaining privacy? 

Ans) Achieving security by means of
the following traits: 
- *Proof system:* Though the overhead required for
computation of proofs stands at O(log n), the proofs are recursive in
nature, and any invalid proof is weeded out by the Layer 1 Main Network
in such rare occurrences. All transactions are ensured to be
cryptographically secure as well. The low complexity reduces dependence
on computational resources, relieving a potential bottleneck for
security concerns.
- *Failsafe mechanisms:* Even if a node is
compromised, the system remains secure due to the strength of the
cryptographic proofs. Miden publishes all transaction batch data
on-chain, ensuring that if off-chain data sources fail, transaction data
remains accessible on Ethereum. Any attempted fraud is detectable when
proofs are validated on Ethereum’s Layer
- *Privacy:* Proofs are
generated, transactions are processed, all without disclosing much
information at all, thanks to the zero knowledge nature of Miden.
Through secure multi-party computation, Miden supports private
transactions, letting participants submit transactions without revealing
sensitive data.
- *Salient Features of zk-STARK:* Without a trusted setup,
zk-STARK offers cryptographic protection, and hence provides
transparency.

*Achieving scalability by means of the following traits:*  
- *Cost reduction:* Miden achieves approximately 80-90% gas savings as it only
submits one proof on Ethereum for 1000s of transactions, bundled
together. Thanks to being a Layer 2 solution, the gas cost per
transaction is as low as 1,000 units, compared to 21,000 for Ethereum
base layer transactions.
- *zk-STARK Perks:* Smaller proofs are combined
into a single recursive proof of STARK. This technique enables Miden to
validate thousands of transactions in tandem. The time complexity is
also very low compared to alternate solutions, at O(log n).
- *Roll Up
mechanism:* Transactions are grouped into batches, with a single proof
representing thousands of transactions submitted to Ethereum’s Layer 1,
thereby reducing execution, storage and computation overhead and
reducing the traffic in the mainnet.
- *Parallel Execution:* The VM
processes multiple ZK circuits in parallel, achieving throughput up to
200 TPS, compared to Ethereum Layer 1’s 10-15 TPS. Miden can handle up
to 2,000 TPS, at a Transaction confirmation latency of around 1-3
seconds, much faster than Ethereum’s average 13-15 second block time.

_____________________________________________

#### Question (c): What is the role of the Miden VM in executing smart contracts? 
Ans) I have already explained here what smart
contracts are, what Miden VM is, and how smart contract functions in VM.
Let's look at the role of Smart Contracts in Miden VM:

- Smart contracts are written in high-level languages and then are
compiled into a set of low-level instructions. Miden VM contains its own
instruction set designed for optimized proof generation.
- A data
structure called Merkle Tree is used to represent an incoming program's
memory and initial state. It is a hash based data structure in which
changes in memory or state are updated
- Stack Register, Memory Register
and Instruction Pointer register handle the memory needs of the entire
operation in the VM
- The VM processes each instruction sequentially. If
the currently running program calls for an addition operation, the Miden
VM processes this with a few instructions to add numbers and push the
result onto the stack.
- As the program executes, the VM creates a trace
log and for every memory access (read or write), Miden generates a
Merkle proof.
- Now, the proof generation commences. The steps that were
discussed in a previous question, will take place
- conversion of the
trace log to polynomial form, and testing for low degree, using STARK.
- Finally, the proof, that would include the final state respresented in
the form of a Merkle Root Hash, is submitted to the Layer 1 Network.
Upon verification, the final state is updated on the mainnet. Had a
smart contract executed a token transfer, the proof would include the
new balances, which are then recorded on-chain in a zero knowledge
nature.

_____________________________________________

### Section 3: Future Potential and challenges: 
#### Question (a): Discuss the potential future applications and use cases of Polygon Miden. 

Ans) I
shall list down use cases and applications for Miden that might exist in
nascent stages now, but I feel will benefit in the future by making use
of Polygon Miden for the relevant reasons:

1\. *dApps that prioritise user discretion and data privacy:* Use cases
like online voting and messaging services can benefit from the
resilience and secure nature of Miden, and its scalable robustness. 
- Individual transactions in such applications can make use of STARKs for
quick verification of many transactions in one go
- In the case of voting, Decentralized Autonomous Organization governance executed on
Midem will hugely benefit from the platform's scalability, transparency
and privacy, all key for any voting system
- zkVM can handle messaging and payment computations off-chain while keeping transaction details
private through zk-proofs on-chain, thus making Midem a suitabe choice
for such applications

2\. *Means of communication between central Ethereum and other blockchain
networks:* Miden could serve as an interoperability layer to ensure
secure, efficient asset transfers and communications between Ethereum
and other chains, thus diversifying the network on the whole 
- For
effortlessly transferring tokens with specific conditions or invoking
smart contracts on multiple chains, zkVM can process these instructions
securely off-chain.
- Such cross platform and cross chain transactions
are executed faster in Miden than expected, thanks to its Roll Up
nature. ZK-rollups can also furnish proofs for cross-chain transactions,
enhancing security and rectifying long standing vulnerabilities with
cross chain systems.
- Hence Miden might be a good platform to consider
for such applications

3\. *Blockchain Gaming:*  
- Blockchain gaming's mechanics require fast,
secure microtransactions, allowing real-time interactions in the game.
Along with that, they also require extensive logic (like rendering game
graphics or managing player states). Performing all these transactions
on Layer 1 would be very computation intensive. Layer 2 nature of Miden
will be extremely beneficial for such use cases as it fits the
functional requirements perfectly
- Upgrading characters and making
modifications to the assets in the games count as microtransactions.
Miden’s rollup feature processes many transactions in bulk, lowering
per-transaction costs and also allows players to make small in-game
payments easily.
- ZK-rollups can handle large numbers of NFT
transactions without bloating the Ethereum network. All these attributes
will be highly useful for GameFi & Blockchain Games

4\. *Decentralized Finance and Enterprise applications:* Use cases for
such applications would include trading, asset monitoring, supply chain
management and financial operations. For all these, the dApp needs to be
highly performing, cost effective, very easily scalable based on the
incumbent traffic, and highly secure. Miden is apt for such requirements
thanks to the following traits:  
- *Off Chain execution:* Heavy loads of
transactions, like iquidity calculations or lending risk assessments or
load balancing in supply chains, etc, are executed off the main chain,
in batches, thereby drastically reducing the load on the mainnet and
preserving accuracy without incurring high cost.
- *User data privacy:*
All data involved in such applications are sensitive in nature.
Privacy-enhanced transactions using zk-STARK proofs can help shield
sensitive information from public view, as it incorporates data such as
such as user holdings and critical credentials, attracting institutional
investors who are cautious about full transparency.
- *ZK-rollups*
aggregate and compress multiple transactions into a single proof,
drastically reducing data needed to be stored on-chain. This makes
transactions both faster and cheaper while retaining the security of
Ethereum's Layer 1.

These are some of the future use cases and applications that I consider
to be apt for utilizing Miden optimally.

_____________________________________________

#### Question (b): What are the main technical challenges that Miden needs to address to realize its full potential? 

Ans) Despite all the bells and
whistles of early promise shown by Miden since its inception, there are
areas that need addressing, inorder to make Polygon Miden realise its
full potential. The issues addressed below are in no particular order of
preference:

1\. *Point of view of a Developer:*  
- Compared to some other alternative
solutions, Miden does not possess such extensive documentation, which
creates an entry barrier for emerging developers. Since the underlying
mechanisms involve Cryptography algorithms, STARKs and other zero
knowledge techniques, which are difficult to understand in nature, the
supposed non-native nature of development in this platform makes
widespread adoption a far-fetched dream.
- Alternates like Optimism &
zkSync have attracted larger population of developers as they possess
easy-to-use toolkits and detailed documentation.
- It would benefit the
developer community if Miden also has a repository of tools, SDKs and
detailed documentations along with necessary abstractions.

2\. *Proportional growth of State Size:*  
- Since Miden encourages scaling
of transaction volume, a subsequent consequence would be the enlargement
of state size, that contains all relevant information about the states
and accounts. This size would grow rapidly, in line with the overall
scaling. Thus, it has an adverse impact on the speed and performance of
the rollups. Running out of space in the network is also an issue that
will arise in the long run, if the same problem persists.
- Miden
requires newer and more efficient state compression and pruning
techniques to avoid excessive growth of on-chain data. Storage
management in the mainnet is a critical issue that needs to be resolved
soon.

3\. *Readiness of Data:* 
- Availability of data for proof generation is
always a careful balancing act, in Miden. There are two sides to this
issue. Without public access to transaction data, nodes cannot validate
the proofs. The data required to verify transactions must be stored
on-chain, but the cost of doing so on Ethereum is very very high, and it
will continue to grow as the network scales.
- As a counter measure,
Miden can employ off-chain data storage, where data is stored elsewhere,
and only commitments (Merkle Tree) are posted to Ethereum. This
approach, while being cost-effective, must balance between reducing data
storage costs and maintaining verifiable transaction integrity.
- To
address this, Miden should ensure that data remains accessible and
verifiable, even if a single storage node fails.

4\. *Interoperability across Blockchains:*  
- Something that has remained
elusive since the inception and widespread adoptation of Miden is the
Cross-chain interoperability between Miden, Ethereum, and other L2
solutions. For Miden to be fully useful, it must interact seamlessly
with other blockchains, allowing assets and data to move freely across
chains.
- As discussed in a previous section, interoperability and
compatibility with other blockchains remains a challenge. Transferring
assets across chains relies on secure bridging, which is challenging
because each chain has different rules and security mechanisms.
- Miden
needs secure, efficient bridges that can handle cross-chain transfers
and calls without introducing new vulnerabilities.

These are some of the challenges and areas where Miden is found lacking
according to me, addressing which will help realise its full potential

#### Question (c): How can Miden contribute to the broader ZK ecosystem and interoperability with other chains? 
Ans) The answer to this question can
seem like a tangent to the previous question, as addressing all the
above concerns will enable Miden to greatly contribute to the broader ZK
ecosystem, in the following ways:

1\. Interoperability across different blockchains will open up a whole
new world of possibilities. It can be done using the power of zk STARKS,
by creating zkBridges which use zk proofs to ensure secure and
trust-setup-less interoperability. Bridges generate proofs for specific
transactions that need to be verified on or shared to other blockchains.
These zkBridges enhance security by ensuring that just the final proofs
are what is transferred between chains, and not any constituent data,
thereby reducing the risks associated with usual bridge vulnerabilities.

2\. Miden VM is the virtual machine specifically optimized for ZK
computations that enables developers to create custom execution
environments. Miden’s design will allow it to be compatible with
EVM-based chains, bridging it with the Ethereum ecosystem, extending
what was conveyed in the previous point. Ethereum already plays host to
many DeFi and NFT applications, and interoperability with all those
would enable seamless asset transfers and application interactions
across chains, diversifying the applications.

3\. Miden uses zk-STARKs for efficient data compression by means of
rollup, reducing the cost and space requirements for transactions on the
blockchain, thereby improving scalability and enhancing throughput.
Unlike other solutions, Miden’s STARK proofs are optimized for
large-scale data, making them ideal for applications like decentralized
gaming, where large amounts of data must be processed frequently.

4\. STARKs, unlike SNARKs, do not require a trusted setup, making Miden
more decentralized and transparent. Trusted setups are considered a
centralization risk because they rely on trusted parties for initial
security parameters. The way STARK is designed, improves long-term
security, especially for mission-critical applications that need
verifiable, decentralized trust assumptions.

5\. Miden helps in reducing the entry barrier for interested developers
and improved adoption thanks to its open-source tooling, including
libraries and proof generation templates. This helps in leveraging the
salient advantages provided by this platform for building ZK-powered
decentralised applications for any use case. Miden uses Rust for its
core components, which is efficient and memory-safe, thereby also making
it accessible for developers familiar with high-performance coding
languages.

Polygon Miden represents a substantial step forward in zero-knowledge
proof technology and blockchain interoperability. Its STARK-based
proofs, modular Miden VM, zkBridges, and privacy-preserving capabilities
make it a highly flexible, scalable, and secure option for cross-chain
interactions.
